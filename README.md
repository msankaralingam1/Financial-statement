Rental vs. Franchise: Evaluating the Best Investment Strategy
When considering whether to invest in McDonald's franchise operations or opt for a rental model, a detailed financial analysis is crucial. Our model assesses both options based on key financial metrics.
Rental Model: Stability with Lower Returns
✅ Steady Income Growth: Rental income starts at $2.25M in 2025, growing to $3.06M by 2029.
 ✅ Low Risk: Predictable cash flows with minimal operational involvement.
 ⚠️ High Upfront Investment: Requires $45M for land purchase, impacting liquidity.
Franchise Model: Higher Profitability & Growth
🚀 Higher Returns: After-tax profits start at $5.88M in 2025, rising to $8.19M by 2029.
 📈 Revenue Growth: Total sales increase from $59.94M (2025) to $96.27M (2029).
 ⚠️ Higher Risk: Dependent on market conditions and operational efficiency.
Key Takeaway
🔹 If stability & minimal effort are priorities → Rental Model is ideal.
 🔹 If maximizing profitability is the goal → Franchise Model is the better option.
